3. should/could do feature/version
4. Command Handler (validate/read/parse?/insert to database)
file read
5. Validations for files / exception handlers

7. Models

logging
DI?
unit tests / how to run

further
if the process automated? cache/circuit breakers/object logging/fallbacks?
later exception handling / fallbacks / retries if necessary
the imported data could have many structures after (one object goes to database for sure + other during the process could be used/sent anywhere if needed)
