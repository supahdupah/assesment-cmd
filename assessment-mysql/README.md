# SQL Test Assignment

Attached is a mysqldump of a database to be used during the test.

Below are the questions for this test. Please enter a full, complete, working SQL statement under each question. We do not want the answer to the question. We want the SQL command to derive the answer. We will copy/paste these commands to test the validity of the answer.

**Example:**

_Q. Select all users_

- Please return at least first_name and last_name

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users;


------

**â€” Test Starts Here â€”**

1. Select users whose id is either 3,2 or 4
- Please return at least: all user fields

SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (3,2,4)

2. Count how many basic and premium listings each active user has
- Please return at least: first_name, last_name, basic, premium

SELECT 
id,
first_name,
last_name, 
status,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM listings WHERE listings.user_id = users.id AND listings.status = 2) as basicCount,
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM listings WHERE listings.user_id = users.id AND listings.status = 3) as premiumCount
FROM users where users.status = 2

3. Show the same count as before but only if they have at least ONE premium listing
- Please return at least: first_name, last_name, basic, premium


4. How much revenue has each active vendor made in 2013
- Please return at least: first_name, last_name, currency, revenue


5. Insert a new click for listing id 3, at $4.00
- Find out the id of this new click. Please return at least: id

INSERT INTO clicks (listing_id, price, currency) VALUES (3,4.00,'USD');
SELECT @@IDENTITY AS 'Identity'; 
#comment - using @@IDENTITY get the last identity created (from all scopes), otherwise - use a simple SELECT statement/ Output statement 

6. Show listings that have not received a click in 2013
- Please return at least: listing_name
SELECT name, id  
FROM listings
WHERE listings.id 
NOT IN (
SELECT DISTINCT listing_id FROM clicks WHERE created >= '2013-01-01' AND created <= '2013-12-31'
)

7. For each year show number of listings clicked and number of vendors who owned these listings
- Please return at least: date, total_listings_clicked, total_vendors_affected

SELECT YEAR(created) as year, listing_id, COUNT(*) from clicks group by listing_id,year

#not finished

8. Return a comma separated string of listing names for all active vendors
- Please return at least: first_name, last_name, listing_names

SELECT id,
       first_name,
       last_name,
       (SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(listings.name)
         FROM listings
         WHERE users.id = listings.user_id) AS listing_names
FROM Users
